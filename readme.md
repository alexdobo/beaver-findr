# Beaver Findr

This tool gets a random location in Whistler Village and downloads a streetview image of the location.
The user can then press the right arrow key to say the image is not a match, and the left arrow key to say that it is a match.
The result will then be saved to 'checked.csv'
The down arrow key is used to skip an image, and the up arrow key is used to change the last image.


This is useful for the [Find The Beaver](https://www.facebook.com/findthebeaver/) contest, where they give you an image, and you are required to find the beaver which is at the location that the image was taken.

To get this to work, create apiKey.txt and place in your Google StreetView API Key
